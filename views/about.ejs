		<p id="aboutp">
			My name is Saksham Ahluwalia and I am a full time student at University of Toronto - St.George pursuing mathematics and statistics.
			<hr>
			Even though I am pursuing mathematics and statistics I have a strong interest in Computer Science. Over the summer or whenever I get some free time
			I work on numerous projects that help me hone my skills as a programmer and help other people in the process by building applications that can increase efficiency
			and productivity of the user.
			<hr>
			I am proficient in python and use it to in nearly all of my projects. Furthermore, after completing an online Web-developer bootcamp, I feel confident with working in HTML,
			CSS and JavaScript. To add on, I have also worked with Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Passport, Beautiful Soup, Requests, urllib,
			JSON, XML and more.
			<hr>
			Send me an email at sakshamahluwalia5@gmail.com for inquiries or suggestions regarding the website. I look forward to your emails.
