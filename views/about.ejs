		<p id="aboutp">
			My name is Saksham Ahluwalia and I am a full time student at University of Toronto - St.George pursuing mathematics and statistics. I have a strong 
			interest in computer science and I am planning on majoring in it as well. Over the summer or whenever I get some free time I work on numerous 
			projects that help me hone my skills as a programmer and help other people in the process by building applications that can increase efficiency and
			productivity of the user. 
			<br />
			<br />
			I am proficient in python and have used it in nearly all of my applications. Furthermore, after completing an online Web-developer bootcamp, I feel confident
			with working in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Bootstrap, Semantic UI and Passport. To add on, I have also worked with Beautiful Soup, 
			Requests, Urllib, JSON, XML and more.
			<br />
			<br />
			Send me an email at sakshamahluwalia5@gmail.com for inquiries or suggestions regarding the website. I look forward to your emails.
